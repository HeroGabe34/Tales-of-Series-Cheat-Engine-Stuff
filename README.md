Thank you Sora3100 for creating your Cheat tables as they were the basis for me to understanding how to use the Cheat Engine for finding stuff in these Tales of games!


Here is a link to his cheat tables:https://github.com/Sora3100/Tales_of_Cheat_Tables


To get the cheat tables, just click on the table you want then look where it says raw and click on the down arrow symbol to the right of it to download.

**Tales of Destiny DC**

Use this on the PCSX2 emulator, idk about any other platform or hardware.

Based off of what Sora3100's table already had, plus a bit extra!

Can add/remove every type of item from inventory (Except key items and some useless treasure items I didn't add)

Able to change party members strategies to anyone's strategy than the 6 that each member is locked to. (Ex:Leon can now be set on the heal strategy and be the healer instead of Rutee)

Able to individually edit each party members artes and save it via shortcuts

Pressing \ activates a ton of modified stuff thats different from the base game, its just stuff I changed to make the game feel a bit different and I guess easier? 

**Modified items**

Few Arte edits, as in I replaced some artes with different ones for most party members (Ex:Leon knows Holy lance and Recover, replaced Focus and Pow Hammer.)

All Artes cost 1 CC

Very fast spell casting

Most artes have different elements/attack attributes added/removed (Ex: Lilith's Raindow Arch Arte now has every element in its attribute instead of just aqua)

Weapon edits

Swordian devices at 999 points




**Up Next is Tales of the Abyss!**
