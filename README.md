Thank you Sora3100 for creating your Cheat tables as they were the basis for me to understanding how to use the Cheat Engine for finding stuff in these Tales of games!


Here is a link to their cheat tables for other Tales of games:https://github.com/Sora3100/Tales_of_Cheat_Tables


To get the cheat tables, just click on the table you want then look where it says raw and click on the down arrow symbol to the right of it to download.






**Tales of Destiny DC**





Use this on the PCSX2 emulator, idk about any other platform or hardware.

Based off of what Sora3100's table already had, plus a bit extra!

Can add/remove every type of item from inventory (Except key items and some useless treasure items I didn't add)

Able to change party members strategies to anyone's strategy than the 6 that each member is locked to. (Ex:Leon can now be set on the heal strategy and be the healer instead of Rutee)

Able to individually edit each party members artes and save it via shortcuts

Pressing \ activates a ton of modified stuff thats different from the base game, its just stuff I changed to make the game feel a bit different and I guess easier? 

**Modified items**

Few Arte edits, as in I replaced some artes with different ones for most party members (Ex:Leon knows Holy lance and Recover, replaced Focus and Pow Hammer.)

All Artes cost 1 CC

Very fast spell casting

Most artes have different elements/attack attributes added/removed (Ex: Lilith's Raindow Arch Arte now has every element in its attribute instead of just aqua)

Weapon edits

Swordian devices at 999 points





**Tales of the Abyss**





Use this on the PCSX2 emulator, idk about any other platform or hardware.

Based off of what Sora3100's table already had, plus a bit extra!

Change the amount of gald/casino chips you can have

Override strategies of party members, (EX: strike artes tactic on members who don't usually have it.)

Add or remove all items in the game

Can edit the stats of all weapons/armors/hands/most accessory items

Can equip the same C. Core to multiple party members via equipment editor

Change the difficulty value without actually having to earn Very hard/Unknown difficulty. (I don't know why you would want to do Unknown on your very first run through?)

Edit grade and grade shop options (only available after you beat the game at least once and can only access it in the grade shop menu)

Pressing \ modifies the game, making it different from a vanilla play through. 

**Modified Items**

All artes cost 1 TP

Luke/Guy/Natalia/Anise got modified artes. Replaced artes that didn't have a FOF arte with Spell Artes. Luke/Asch/Guy got a bunch of Spell Artes added in their arte list. Anise I added 3 more Spell artes for her, and Natalia I gave 2 more Spell Artes. (Wasn't able to add healing artes to anyone so Tear and Natalia are still the only healers in the game)

Most artes have different elemental attributes than what they had orignally. (EX: Demon fist is now a dark elemental arte)

Artes you would have earned via side quests are now part of the main level up pool, (EX: Luke/Asch can learn demon fist at level 3.) You can still learn them via side quests.

Luke/Guy/Natalia can now learn AD Skills relating to offensive Spell Artes.

Modified stats for most equipment (Weapons/Armors/Hands/Accessories like hats, circlets,shoes,capes,helmets)

**Up next:TBD**
