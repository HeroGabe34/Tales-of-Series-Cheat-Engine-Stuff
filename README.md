Thank you Sora3100 for creating your Cheat tables as they were the basis for me to understanding how to use the Cheat Engine for finding stuff in these Tales of games!


Here is a link to their cheat tables for other Tales of games:https://github.com/Sora3100/Tales_of_Cheat_Tables


To get the cheat tables, just click on the table you want then look where it says raw and click on the down arrow symbol to the right of it to download.


Got any questions or issues with the cheat tables? Message me on discord since that is the fastest way to communicate with me. gabe3287 is my name on discord.





**Tales of Destiny DC**





Use this on the PCSX2 emulator, idk about any other platform or hardware.

Based off of what Sora3100's table already had, plus a bit extra!

Can add/remove every type of item from inventory (Except key items and some useless treasure items I didn't add)

Able to change party members strategies to anyone's strategy than the 6 that each member is locked to. (Ex:Leon can now be set on the heal strategy and be the healer instead of Rutee)

Able to individually edit each party members artes and save it via shortcuts

Pressing \ activates a ton of modified stuff thats different from the base game, its just stuff I changed to make the game feel a bit different and I guess easier? 

**Modified items**

Few Arte edits, as in I replaced some artes with different ones for most party members (Ex:Leon knows Holy lance and Recover, replaced Focus and Pow Hammer.)

All Artes cost 1 CC

Very fast spell casting

Most artes have different elements/attack attributes added/removed (Ex: Lilith's Raindow Arch Arte now has every element in its attribute instead of just aqua)

Swordian ability and final Weapon ability edits for non-swordian party members. 

Swordian devices at 999 points





**Tales of the Abyss**





Use this on the PCSX2 emulator, idk about any other platform or hardware.

Based off of what Sora3100's table already had, plus a bit extra!

Change the amount of gald/casino chips you can have

Override strategies of party members, (EX: strike artes tactic on members who don't usually have it.)

Add or remove all items in the game

Can edit FSC abilities (EX:Add the Steal effect on artes that don't have it)

Can edit the stats of all weapons/armors/hands/most accessory items

Can equip the same C. Core to multiple party members via equipment editor

Change the difficulty value without actually having to earn Very hard/Unknown difficulty.

Edit grade and grade shop options (only available after you beat the game at least once and can only access it in the grade shop menu)

Pressing \ modifies the game, making it different from a vanilla play through. 

**Modified Items**

All artes cost 1 TP

Luke/Asch/Guy/Natalia/Anise got modified artes. Replaced artes that didn't have a FOF arte with Spell Artes, some got new healing artes as well. Tear and Jade didn't get any new arte changes. These new Spell Artes DO NOT have a FOF version

Most artes have different elemental attributes than what they had orignally. (EX: Havoc Strike is an Earth Arte now)

Everyones FSC abilities have been altered.

Artes you would have earned via side quests are now part of the main level up pool. You can still earn the side quests artes normally.

Luke/Guy/Natalia can now learn AD Skills relating to offensive Spell Artes.

Modified stats for most equipment (Weapons/Armors/Hands/Accessories like hats, circlets,shoes,capes,helmets)





**Tales of Symphonia**





Played on Steam as of January 2026 with NO TSFIX.

This cheat table is a combination of Sora3100, sdailey01, and another persons contribution I found on Fearless Revolution.com. I did the individual arte edits (Not the actual scripting) and finding the addresses for the strategies.

I put down notes in the cheat table for answers to questions some may have during a playthrough

This cheat table consists of:

Edit party formations

Changing character stats and levels

Change gald amount

EXP, Gald, Grade Multipliers

Chain same arte types (EX:Chain Demon fang with Double Demon Fang)

Allow multiple uses of Mystic Artes and ignore overlimit requirements (EX:Kratos can use his mystic arte during overlimit without having flamberge equipped)

Change character tech alignment (S/T scale)

Add/Remove items from inventory

Change run speed in dungeons/towns, NOT OVERWORLD

Can use the rheiards anytime in overworld

Change characters EX skills and EX Gems

Activate/Deactivate Devil's Arms true power

Save anywhere

Change affection levels of party members

Get all titles and change outfits without needing to have the title on

Get all recipes and even max it out for everyone

Can learn all artes immediately

Can turn on the JPN skit voices when playing with English dub

**Modified Items I did**

Change the Strategies of party members
(EX:Give Lloyd the L-Range Magic Position or giving Colette the Heal command for TP usage)

All TP usage is 1

Spell casting is VERY fast for allies and foes
(As a side note I was NOT able to remove that pause after activating a tier 2/3 spell and if other party members are using these high tier spells they will still be in their encantation animation and waiting until the first person's spell finishes, its just hardcoded in the game to do that so I recommend to only have one spell caster in the party and the others only use tier 1 spells. This can also apply to healing spell artes as well.)

Player controlled and AI party members can combo artes IN ANY ORDER AND FOR AS LONG AS YOU WANT, just like in modern Tales of games
(As a heads up, comboing for a long duration will let your damage become REALLY low and the enemy will eventually get downed to get out of it, they won't be able to get comboed again for a little bit.)
(Presea can somewhat combo but some of her artes don't really allow her to keep chaining artes)

Every party member can learn ALL OF THEIR ARTES REGARDLESS OF THEIR TECH ALIGNMENT (S/T Scale) AND ARTE USAGE. (EX:Lloyd can learn Double Demon Fang AND Fierce Demon Fang at the same time now and without having Demon Fang used 50 times)

Every party members artes has an elemental affinty on it EX:Lloyd's Demon Fang is now a Fire Arte.

Modified every party members artes they learned, play the game to find out whats new for each member!
(Removed all of Lloyd's combination artes, Tempest Thrust, Raining Tiger Blade, etc... due to those artes unable to chain with other artes.)

Edited the text of artes that had no name nor no description to them (Thank you sdaily01 for the help on that!)

**Up Next:TBD**
