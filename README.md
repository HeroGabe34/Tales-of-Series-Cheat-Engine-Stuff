Thank you Sora3100 for creating your Cheat tables as they were the basis for me to understanding how to use the Cheat Engine for finding stuff in these Tales of games!


Here is a link to their cheat tables for other Tales of games:https://github.com/Sora3100/Tales_of_Cheat_Tables


To get the cheat tables, just click on the table you want then look where it says raw and click on the down arrow symbol to the right of it to download.






**Tales of Destiny DC**





Use this on the PCSX2 emulator, idk about any other platform or hardware.

Based off of what Sora3100's table already had, plus a bit extra!

Can add/remove every type of item from inventory (Except key items and some useless treasure items I didn't add)

Able to change party members strategies to anyone's strategy than the 6 that each member is locked to. (Ex:Leon can now be set on the heal strategy and be the healer instead of Rutee)

Able to individually edit each party members artes and save it via shortcuts

Pressing \ activates a ton of modified stuff thats different from the base game, its just stuff I changed to make the game feel a bit different and I guess easier? 

**Modified items**

Few Arte edits, as in I replaced some artes with different ones for most party members (Ex:Leon knows Holy lance and Recover, replaced Focus and Pow Hammer.)

All Artes cost 1 CC

Very fast spell casting

Most artes have different elements/attack attributes added/removed (Ex: Lilith's Raindow Arch Arte now has every element in its attribute instead of just aqua)

Weapon edits

Swordian devices at 999 points





**Tales of the Abyss**





Use this on the PCSX2 emulator, idk about any other platform or hardware.

Based off of what Sora3100's table already had, plus a bit extra!

Change the amount of gald/casino chips you can have

Override strategies of party members, (EX: strike artes tactic on members who don't usually have it.)

Add or remove all items in the game

Can edit FSC abilities (EX:Add the Steal effect on artes that don't have it)

Can edit the stats of all weapons/armors/hands/most accessory items

Can equip the same C. Core to multiple party members via equipment editor

Change the difficulty value without actually having to earn Very hard/Unknown difficulty.

Edit grade and grade shop options (only available after you beat the game at least once and can only access it in the grade shop menu)

Pressing \ modifies the game, making it different from a vanilla play through. 

**Modified Items**

All artes cost 1 TP

Luke/Asch/Guy/Natalia/Anise got modified artes. Replaced artes that didn't have a FOF arte with Spell Artes, some got new healing artes as well. Tear and Jade didn't get any new arte changes. These new Spell Artes DO NOT have a FOF version

Most artes have different elemental attributes than what they had orignally. (EX: Havoc Strike is an Earth Arte now)

Everyones FSC abilities have been altered.

Artes you would have earned via side quests are now part of the main level up pool. You can still earn the side quests artes normally.

Luke/Guy/Natalia can now learn AD Skills relating to offensive Spell Artes.

Modified stats for most equipment (Weapons/Armors/Hands/Accessories like hats, circlets,shoes,capes,helmets)

**Up next:TBD**
