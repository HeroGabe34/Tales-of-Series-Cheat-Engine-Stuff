Thank you Sora3100 for having your Cheat tables as the basics for me understanding how to use the Cheat Engine for finding stuff in these Tales of games!

Tales of Destiny DC

Based off of what Sora3100's table already had, plus more!

Can add/remove every type of item from inventory (Except key items)

Able to change party members strategies than what they are locked to. (Ex:Leon can now be the healer of the group)
